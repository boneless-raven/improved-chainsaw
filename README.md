# HealthNet

HealthNet is meant to enable their hospitals in the US to be able to manage both employees and patients. The successful implementation should make it easy for users to effortlessly sign-up as patients so that the hospital can, without difficulty, manage their procedures and patient related tasks to optimize day-to-day work-flow.
The HealthNet product is intended to improve hospitals by providing an easy mechanism for managing employees, gathering statistical data on the inner workings of the hospital, signing up patients, making appointments, and allowing ease of transfer of both patients and their information between hospitals.
